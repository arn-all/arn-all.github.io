I work as a post-doc at CEA Saclay, where I use machine learning / deep learning methods to analyze processes that happen at the atomic scale ðŸ”¬ in metals: 
defects formation, thermally activated process, phase transformations, materials evolution in environment, ... 

For this, we developed novel atomic descriptors and machine-learning force-fields together with [Mihai-Cosmin Marinica](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Yfj9RqUAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Alexandra M. Goryaeva](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=3VPSML8AAAAJ&hl=en).

I intensively use computational methods such as molecular dynamics to study solid state physics problems at different scales, such as [simulations of plasticity in metals](https://journals.aps.org/prmaterials/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevMaterials.6.013608), which is mediated by dislocation motion -actually the subject of [my thesis](https://theses.hal.science/tel-03728547).
