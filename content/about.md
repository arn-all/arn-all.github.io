  <p>
  I am a permanent research scientist at ASNR Cadarache since 2024, in charge of studies on steel ageing using advanced simulation methods. 

  I use ideas from condensed matter physics, metallurgy and machine learning to analyze processes happening at the atomic scaleðŸ”¬ in metals: 
  defect formation, thermally activated process, phase transformations, materials evolution in environment, etc. 

  Using massively parallel computational methods such as molecular dynamics, I study solid state physics problems at different scales, using both classical and ML-based methods.
  An example is the [simulation of plasticity in metals](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevMaterials.6.013608), which is mediated by dislocation motion --actually the subject of [my thesis](https://theses.hal.science/tel-03728547).

  Previously, I was a post-doc at CEA Saclay-SRMP, where I developed efficient atomic descriptors for geometric and chemical analysis of atomic arrangements, as well as machine-learned force-fields, together with Mihai-Cosmin Marinica and Alexandra M. Goryaeva.

  For my PhD, I worked with David Rodney (Univ. Lyon), Michel Perez (INSA) and Fabienne Ribeiro (IRSN) on the [depinning of dislocations from interstitial solutes](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevMaterials.6.013608), introducing a new [potential for Fe-C](https://github.com/arn-all/FeC-EAM-potential). 
  I defended in Dec. 2021 at UniversitÃ© de Lyon--UCBL.
