  I am a permanent research scientist at IRSN Cadarache since 2024, in charge of studies on steel ageing using advanced simulation methods. 

  Previously, I was a post-doc at CEA Saclay, where I developed machine learning methods to analyze processes happening at the atomic scale ðŸ”¬ in metals: 
  defects formation, thermally activated process, phase transformations, materials evolution in environment,... 

  For this, I developed efficient atomic descriptors and machine-learning (ML) force-fields, together with [Mihai-Cosmin Marinica](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Yfj9RqUAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Alexandra M. Goryaeva](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=3VPSML8AAAAJ&hl=en).

  I intensively use massively parallel computational methods such as molecular dynamics to study solid state physics problems at different scales, using both classical and ML-based methods.
  An example is the [simulation of plasticity in metals](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevMaterials.6.013608), which is mediated by dislocation motion --actually the subject of [my thesis](https://theses.hal.science/tel-03728547).

  For my PhD, I worked with David Rodney (Univ. Lyon), Michel Perez (INSA) and Fabienne Ribeiro (IRSN) on the [depinning of dislocations from interstitial solutes](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevMaterials.6.013608), introducing a new [potential for Fe-C](https://github.com/arn-all/FeC-EAM-potential). 
  I defended in Dec. 2021 at UniversitÃ© de Lyon--UCBL.
